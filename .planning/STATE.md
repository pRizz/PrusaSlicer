# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-03)

**Core value:** Maintainers and contributors can build, test, and work on PrusaSlicer through a simple, repeatable, authoritative toolchain on Linux and macOS.
**Current focus:** Phase 4: Add Local Tooling and Validation

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 5 (Add Local Tooling and Validation)
Plan: Not started
Status: Context gathered, ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-07 — Gathered Phase 4 context for tests, formatting, lint, and editor metadata

Progress: [██████░░░░] 60%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 4 | 21 min | 5 min |
| 02 | 2 | 9 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 6 min, 15 min, 0 min, 6 min, 3 min
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Include an explicit Bazel vs Meson + Ninja evaluation phase
- Initialization: Linux and macOS are the first-class migration targets
- Initialization: Keep the project focused on build/tooling migration only
- Phase 01-01: Use a weighted scorecard plus hard gates and a real PrusaSlicer proof slice for the build-system decision
- Phase 01-02: Select Bazel as the Phase 2 target, with Meson + Ninja as the explicit fallback
- Phase 02-01: Use a thin `./prusa` wrapper as the Bazel-first repo front door instead of hiding Bazel or colliding with the existing `build/` directory
- Phase 02-02: Keep platform/toolchain work at placeholder skeleton scope and route all system-library exceptions through one centralized registry
- Phase 03 context: Use a CLI/core proof slice first, not a full GUI proof
- Phase 03 context: Treat macOS as the immediate proving ground, but require explicit Linux evidence in the same target shape
- Phase 03 context: Every bridge must be visible, scoped, and temporary by default
- Phase 03 replan: Replace the oversized 2-wave proof with a 4-wave dependency ladder, starting from a tiny macOS binary boundary and narrowing bridge scope aggressively
- Phase 03 complete: Prove the same bounded Bazel-owned binary/test slice on macOS and Linux/arm64 with explicit bridge and system-library classifications
- Phase 04 context: Make a bounded non-GUI core test surface, formatting flow, lint pass, and editor metadata path usable from Bazel before attempting CI authority work
- Phase 04 context: Prefer high-signal bounded tooling coverage with explicit exclusions over broad but noisy pseudo-parity

### Pending Todos

1 pending todo:

- Add justfile Bazel convenience commands (`tooling`) — capture a repo-root `justfile` that wraps common Bazel and `./prusa` workflows without changing the authoritative build path.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 must stay bounded to local tooling and validation; CI rollout and authority transfer remain Phase 5 work.
- Tests, formatting, lint, and editor metadata should all expose clear scope boundaries and tracked temporary gaps instead of overstating coverage.
